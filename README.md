# MR3D

MR3D is a **3D rendering engine** written in C++. Intended to be user-**centric** instead of user-**friendly**, this software aims to provide a minimal framework for rendering 3D models & scenes. As free software licensed under the GPL (v3), the user is encouraged to modify the source code how they see fit.

### Features
* Functions such as `Load` and `Update`.
* Structures and classes such as `Vector4`, `Matrix4`, `Triangle` and `Mesh`.

### Installation
**MR3D does not and will not contain any pre-built binaries**. We encourage the user to modify and extend the framework instead of using it as-is, due to its minimal nature. As such, **it is recommended to include the source code in your project**. You should be familiar with how C/C++ libraries are compiled and used.
